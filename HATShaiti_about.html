<h5>What We Do</h5>
<p>HATS-Haiti is involved in the local community with several varied programs that change to meet needs as they arise. Ongoing programs include the children’s home, school, Sunday School and regular appearances on Radio Creole by visiting workers. Other programs include chicken and goat donations, cholera vaccine, food packages and or financial help as needs demand and resources are available.</p>

<h5>Children’s home</h5>
<p>The Hands Across the Sea children’s home has 14 children in full-time care, ranging in age from 1-17 years, who are cared for in a loving family-style arrangement. We are ready to accept new orphans as the need arises in the community. By providing financial support, food aid and school sponsorship, we can help families care for their orphaned nieces, nephews, cousins, or siblings.</p>

<h5>School</h5>

<h5>Community Outreach</h5>
<p>Hands Across the Sea provides ongoing outreach to the wider community through practical assistance including emergency assistance, community development programs and community partnerships.</p>

<p>Our community outreach includes providing financial aid and nutritional support for families in great need, clothing distribution, and assistance in covering medical costs at the nearby hospital for families in crisis. We work in collaboration with local churches and we support local organizations and initiatives whenever possible. To combat rising malnutrition rates in the Artibonite Valley, we are currently providing nutritional support to hungry families through the distribution of rice, beans and oil. As part of our ongoing community outreach, we help widows and the elderly who have little or no family support.</p>
