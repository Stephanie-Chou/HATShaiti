			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<h5>Hands Across the Sea – Haiti</h5>
			<p>Hands Across the Sea – Haiti (HATS-Haiti) is a non-profit organization serving needy children and families in Deschappelles, Haiti. This interdenominational Christian ministry is comprised of a children’s home, a school from preschool – grade 9, and community development initiatives. </p>
			<h5>Children's Home</h5>
			<p>The Hands Across the Sea children’s home has 14 children in full-time care, ranging in age from 1-17 years, who are cared for in a loving family-style arrangement. We are ready to accept new orphans as the need arises in the community. In addition to caring for children in our children’s home, we provide support to needy children and their families in the community in order to maintain the family unit whenever possible. By providing financial support, food aid and school sponsorship, we can help families care for their orphaned nieces, nephews, cousins, or siblings.</p>
			<h5>Community Outreach</h5>
			<p>Hands Across the Sea also provides ongoing outreach to the wider community through practical assistance including emergency assistance, community development programs and community partnerships.</p>
