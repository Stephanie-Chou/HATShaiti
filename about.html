<p>Hands Across the Sea provides ongoing outreach to the wider community through practical assistance including emergency assistance, community development programs and community partnerships.</p>

<p>Our community outreach includes providing financial aid and nutritional support for families in great need, clothing distribution, and assistance in covering medical costs at the nearby hospital for families in crisis. We work in collaboration with local churches and we support local organizations and initiatives whenever possible. To combat rising malnutrition rates in the Artibonite Valley, we are currently providing nutritional support to hungry families through the distribution of rice, beans and oil. As part of our ongoing community outreach, we help widows and the elderly who have little or no family support.</p>
